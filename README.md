# Algorithms-LeetCode-In-Swift
This repository is a collection of Leetcode questions and solutions. 

To use this project to test the algorithm result. 
1. Go to the view controller class 
2. Invoke the algorithms in viewDidLoad, where I have already put some examples. 
3. Because all the functions are written in the Algorithms class and they are class functions.
4. To invoke any func, do the following:  
   Algorithms.threeSum([-1,0,1,2,-1,-4])
